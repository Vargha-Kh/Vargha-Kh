### Experiences
#### Image processing Specialist at [Virasad](https://virasad.ir/en/homepage/)
- Working machine vision and using computer vision in
different fields of industrial monitoring, optimization
and image processing.
#### AI Researcher at [SYMO](https://symolife.com/)
- Earning experience with computer vision and
generative models for classification and object
detection tasks with CNNs and GANs. [Demo](https://demo.symolife.com)
#### NLP Paraphrasing Project [Paraphrase](http://new.keybot.tools)
- This tool have multiple forms of paraphrasing modes and different grammar in English for paraphrasing.
#### [Deep Utils](https://github.com/pooya-mohammadi/deep_utils) Project
- This repository contains the most frequently used deep learning models and functions. Deep_Utils is still under heavy development, so take into consideration that many features may change in the future.
#### [Bread Counter](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Bread_Counter) Project 
- This algorithm is based on YOLO object detection and will count the every breadough that will enter into the oven of the bakery. The purpose of this software is to check whether the bakery will bake the correct amount of the bread that the goverment gave them flour based on that amount.

#### [Hand Pose and gesture recognition](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Mediapipe) Project 
- This algorithm is based on MediaPipe api and we developed the datasets by adding more images of hands and it can be used for hand tracking and even also will be used for object detection integration.

#### [Body Pose detection](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Pose-Detection-using-Media-Pipe) Project 
- This algorithm is based on MediaPipe api and we developed the simple model into a model with more accuracy and it can be used for body tracking and even also will be used for object detection integration including a person's body.
