## AI Researcher
### Personal Profile
I love deep learning. My whole interest in science is about AI and practicing and researching the edge-tech fields in deep learning. I have a professional experience more than 4 years. I have earned knowledge in CV, NLP, Speech and keep updating my self with the recent papers and breakthroughs in this fields.
I have experience in a startup environment and had experience in the entrepreneurship field.
I have experience in computer vision, machine vision, image processing, GANs, transformers, ASR, NLP and â€¦
I self-studied the whole python and machine learning algorithms and programming skills by practicing and working. I am also trying to learn more about data science and MLOPS and willing to learn and work on researchable projects. 
I enjoy every day of my life studying this field.

### Experiences
#### Co-Founder & CTO at [AI Land](https://www.ai-land.ir)
- We provide AI services and Bread Counter](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Bread_Counter) product.
#### AI Lead at [Virasad](https://virasad.ir/en/homepage/)
- I was working as a team lead in machine vision developers and we were using computer vision tech lead in different fields of
industrial monitoring, optimization, and image processing tasks and projects.
#### AI Researcher at [SYMO](https://symolife.com/)
- I spent 6-month internship in symo and earned
experience with computer vision and generative
models for classification and object detection tasks
with CNNs and GANs.

#### NLP Paraphrasing Project [Paraphrase](http://keybot.tools)
- This tool have multiple forms of paraphrasing modes and different grammar in English for paraphrasing.

#### [Deep Utils](https://github.com/pooya-mohammadi/deep_utils) Project
- This repository contains the most frequently used deep learning models and functions. Deep_Utils is still under heavy development, so take into consideration that many features may change in the future.

#### [X-ray chest covid detection using active learning](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Covid-19-detection)
- This our work with x-ray chest covid datasets. Using active learning we managed to build a classifier with 99% accuracy to detect covid symptoms in images. In both Keras and PyTorch frameworks.

#### [Bread Counter](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Bread_Counter) Project 
- This algorithm is based on YOLO object detection and will count the every breadough that will enter into the oven of the bakery. The purpose of this software is to check whether the bakery will bake the correct amount of the bread that the goverment gave them flour based on that amount.

#### [Hand Pose and gesture recognition](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Mediapipe) Project 
- This algorithm is based on MediaPipe api and we developed the datasets by adding more images of hands and it can be used for hand tracking and even also will be used for object detection integration.

#### [Body Pose detection](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/Pose-Detection-using-Media-Pipe) Project 
- This algorithm is based on MediaPipe api and we developed the simple model into a model with more accuracy and it can be used for body tracking and even also will be used for object detection integration including a person's body.

#### [YOLOV7 on custom datasets](https://github.com/Vargha-Kh/YOLOV7_on_BCCD) Project
- This time i used new yolo version to train a model for a medical datasets in roboflow and get the inference with 2.8 ms.
